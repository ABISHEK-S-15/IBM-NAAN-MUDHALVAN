# IBM-NAAN-MUDHALVAN
AI Based Diabetes Prediction System


Overview
This project is an AI-based diabetes prediction system implemented using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The system uses machine learning models to predict the likelihood of an individual having diabetes based on various health-related features. This README file provides instructions on how to set up and run the system.

Dependencies
To run the AI-based diabetes prediction system, you'll need the following dependencies:

Anaconda (or Miniconda)
Jupyter Notebook
Python 3.x
scikit-learn
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
You can install Anaconda, which includes Jupyter Notebook, or Miniconda for a lightweight option. You can also create a conda environment to manage the project-specific dependencies.

You can install the required Python packages using the following commands:



conda create -n diabetes-prediction python=3.x
conda activate diabetes-prediction
conda install scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter
Getting Started
Clone the repository to your local machine:


git clone https://github.com/ABISHEK-S-15/IBM-NAAN-MUDHALVAN.git



Change your current directory to the project folder:

cd AI BASED DIABETES PREDICTION SYSTEM FINALE PROGRAM
Launch Jupyter Notebook:


jupyter notebook
Open the (AI BASED DIABETES PREDICTION SYSTEM FINALE PROGRAM.ipynb) Jupyter Notebook in your browser.

Follow the instructions and run the code cells in the Jupyter Notebook to train the machine learning model and make predictions.



Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook, and navigate to the AI BASED DIABETES PREDICTION SYSTEM FINALE PROGRAM.ipynb file.

Follow the provided instructions within the notebook to load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the machine learning model, and make predictions.

Customize the model or parameters as needed for your specific use case.

Once you have trained the model and made predictions, you can save the results and use them as needed.


Dataset
The system uses a diabetes dataset for training and testing. You can find the dataset in the data folder (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set). Make sure the dataset file is located in the correct directory.

DATASET DETAILS:

Context: 
 This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and 
Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective is to predict based on diagnostic 
measurements whether a patient has diabetes. 

Content: 
 Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a 
larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old 
of Pima Indian heritage. 

✓ Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant 
✓ Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose 
tolerance test 
✓ BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg) 
✓ SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm) 
✓ Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml) 
✓ BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2) 
✓ DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function 
✓ Age: Age (years)
✓ Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)
